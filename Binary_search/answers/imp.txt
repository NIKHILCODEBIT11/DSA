In binary search on answers i will always be asked to find the "minimum" or "maximum" value from set of values.

------> For finding floor value of sqrt of n:-

i have to find "maximum" value of integer which on squaring <=n

Ex :-

3*3 <= 36   Might be the answer
2*2 <= 36   Might be the answer
4*4 <= 36   Might be the answer
5*5 < =36   Might be the answer
6*6 <= 36   Might be the answer
7*7 >  36       REJECTED 

Instead of returning "ans" i can also return "high" as "high" is the first index which has possible answer and "low" is the
first index where answer is not possible.


EXPLAINATION :-

After binary search ends,
high points to the largest value that satisfies the condition
and low points to the first value that violates it.

So returning high gives the same result as ans.

n = 10
floor(sqrt(10)) = 3

Binary search trace
low	high	mid	mid*mid <= 10	action
0	10	5	❌ (25 > 10)	high = 4
0	4	2	✅ (4 ≤ 10)	low = 3
3	4	3	✅ (9 ≤ 10)	low = 4
4	4	4	❌ (16 > 10)	high = 3
